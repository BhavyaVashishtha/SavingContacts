the code for reading names and number from excel file will save them on google contacts

Google doesn't allow bots to access google account, so in ChromeSavingContacts the contacts are saved to google account by going from a different route that is by doing partial sign up in stackoverflow using google account, whose API lets us sign in to google, when that is done, we leave the process in the middle and hit another url.
